# Broadcasting-Portal-For-Colleges
# INTRODUCTION
1.1.OVERVIEW
Nowadays every thing becomes digitalised and services provides by using via internet. Also we get main idea from reading social sites and social media uses. Many users are motivated to outsource their confidential data for example. It is being used by college students within the college. When college want to send important message to each and every student this application can be used widely. It is introduced as an application for easer process of getting notification about college activity. For all that purpose we develop the application. Because now every student and every person can used android phone so that thing we take and develop the application. Now a day in every college want to give the any notice to student then the college having a one large notice board and collage write the notice or stick printout the about the notice on notice board and after that the student go there and view that notice. This is very dull process. To overcome this process we are developed this application. 


# BRIEF DESCRIPTION

The Android applications are creeping into every aspect of student life. We are living in a fast paced world where everything is done instantly. Many students are using android phones to ease the time and burden just on a ‘click of finger’. Good software and meaningful applications provide substantial benefits for students and administrators as well: vastly improved communication, greater accountability, better student compliance, and greater objectivity in evaluation.


With the advancement of android phones, the android applications suddenly became an important aspect for local and global connectivity. Portal is defined as web site that provides a single point of access information and one of the many hosted within a single web portal server. With the introduction of android phones, colleges started developing android applications that would make student information and activities in colleges accessible up-to-date 24/7. It is now termed as college communicator. An online college communicator is one of the essential parts of colleges. As technology evolves alongside, the information revolution, the power of computer makes it easy to distribute and view information needed with just a few clicks.

# PROBLEM DEFINITION
Now a day in every college want to give the any notice to student then the college having a one large notice board and collage write the notice or stick printout the about the notice on notice board and after that the student go there and view that notice. This is very dull process. To overcome this process we are developed this application. 
The given System is divided into three parts client or user side or students, router and server side. At the student side student can register for the first time after registration user can login and see the important message about the college. At the server side there will be one web application in which collage admin will enter the message and it will go to router and from router it will display to student’s mobile app.

# LITERATURE SURVEY

[1] WIFI Router-

	A wireless router enables you to provide wireless (Wife) Internet access to all of your Wife enabled devices such as laptops, game consoles, cell phones and tablets, Streaming devices such as Rook boxes and Internet enabled TV and sound devices, etc. Wi-Fi or Wife is a technology for wireless local area networking with devices based on the IEEE 802.11 standards. Wi-Fi is a trademark of the Wi-Fi Alliance, which restricts the use of the term Wi-Fi Certified to products that successfully complete interoperability certification testing. Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include personal computers, video-game consoles, smart phones, digital cameras, tablet computers, digital audio players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN network and a wireless access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometers achieved by using multiple overlapping access points. Depiction of a device sending information wirelessly to another device, both connected to the local network, in order to print a document Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5 gigahertz (6 cm) SHF ISM radio bands. Having no physical connections, it is more vulnerable to attack than wired connections, such as Ethernet. Web pages that use Transport Layer Security (TLS) are secure, but unencrypted Internet access can easily be detected by intruders. For protection, Wi-Fi has adopted various encryption technologies. The early encryption Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) proved easy to break. Higher quality protocols, such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2) were added later. An optional feature added in 2007, called Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS), and had a serious flaw that allowed an attacker to recover the router's password.[2] The Wi-Fi Alliance has since updated its test plan and certification program to ensure all newly certified devices resist attacks.


[2] Android Application-

	A mobile software application developed for use on devices powered by Google's Android platform.  Android apps are available in the Google Play Store (formerly known as the Android Market), in the Amazon App store and on various Android App-focused sites, and the apps can run on Android smart phones, tablets, Google TV and other devices.
As with Apple and its Apple App Store apps, Google encourages developers to program their own Android apps.  While many Android apps can be freely downloaded, premium apps are also available for purchase by users, with revenues for the latter shared between Google (30%) and the software developer (70%).  Additionally, some Android Apps follow the free maim business model, wherein the app developer can derive revenue on free apps via Google's in-app billing capabilities.

[3] Server –
A server is a computer program that provides services to other computer programs (and their users) in the same or other computers. The computer that a server program runs in is also frequently referred to as a server. That machine may be a dedicated server or used for other purposes as well. In the client/server programming model, a server program awaits and fulfills requests from client programs, which may be running in the same or other computers. A given application in a computer may function as a client with requests for services from other programs and also as a server of requests from other programs. Servers are often categorized in terms of their purpose. A Web server, for example, is a computer program that serves requested HTML pages or files. A Web client is the requesting program associated with the user. The Web browser in your computer is a client that requests HTML files from Web servers.

# SOFTWARE TESTING

7.1. INTRODUCTION
	Testing focuses primarily on the evaluation and the assessment of product quality realized through a number of core practices.It involves the following activities.
Finding and documenting the defects in the software quality.
Generally,advising about perceived software quality.
Providing the validity of the assumption made in the design and requirement.
Specifications through concrete demonstration.
Validating the software product functions as designed.
Validating that the requirements have been implemented appropriately.
Test challenges the assumptions, risks and uncertainty inherent the work of the other disciplines, addressing those concerns by concrete demonstration and impartial evaluation.

7.1.TEST CASE DESIGN

7.1.1.WHITE BOX TESTING
White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing, and structural testing) is a method of testing software that tests internal structures or workings of an application, as opposed to its functionality (i.e. black-box testing). In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases. The tester chooses inputs to exercise paths through the code and determine the appropriate outputs. This is analogous to testing nodes in a circuit, e.g. in-circuit testing (ICT).White-box testing can be applied at the unit, integration and system levels of the software testing process. Although traditional testers tended to think of white-box testing as being done at the unit level, it is used for integration and system testing more frequently today. It can test paths within a unit, paths between units during integration, and between subsystems during a system–level test. Though this method of test design can uncover many errors or problems, it has the potential to miss unimplemented parts of the specification or missing requirements.
7.1.2.BLACK BOX TESTING
Black-box testing is a method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application (e.g. what the software does) without peering into its internal structures or workings. This method of test can be applied to virtually every level of software testing: unit, integration, system and acceptance. It typically comprises most if not all higher level testing, but can also dominate unit testing as well.
